# Unions

Unions are like enums, but you need to track the active field yourself:

```rust,editable
#[repr(C)]
union MyUnion {
    i: u8,
    b: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let u = MyUnion { i: 42 };
    println!("int: {}", unsafe { u.i });
    println!("bool: {}", unsafe { u.b });  // Undefined behavior!
}
```
